## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Lightweight JavaScript Architecture
- **Modular imports**: Only load needed functions per page
- **No unnecessary dependencies**: Uses native Chart.js only for visualization
- **Efficient DOM manipulation**: Minimal reflows and repaints
- **Lazy loading**: Transactions loaded in batches of 10

### 2. CSS Optimizations
- **Single stylesheet**: Eliminates multiple CSS file requests
- **CSS variables**: Consistent theming with minimal overhead
- **Mobile-first responsive**: Efficient breakpoint management
- **Hardware acceleration**: Uses CSS transforms for smooth animations

### 3. Database Optimizations
- **Efficient queries**: Fetch only user's data with proper filtering
- **Minimal API calls**: Batch operations where possible
- **Real-time updates**: Immediate UI feedback while data syncs

### 4. Asset Management
- **CDN for Chart.js**: External CDN reduces bundle size
- **Optimized images**: Receipt uploads validated and compressed
- **Minimal HTTP requests**: All core CSS in single file
