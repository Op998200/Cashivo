## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### From MVP to Full Dashboard
1. **Preserve MVP**: Keep MVP dashboard as entry point
2. **Progressive enhancement**: Add "Advanced View" option
3. **Feature toggle**: Allow users to switch between simple/advanced
4. **Data compatibility**: Ensure all MVP data works with Phase 2 features

### Database Evolution
```sql
-- Phase 2 table additions (already planned in schema)
- budgets (category budgets and limits)
- goals (financial goals tracking)
- recurring_transactions (automated transactions)
- notifications (alert preferences and history)
- user_preferences (advanced settings)
```

### Integration Points
- **Dashboard toggle**: Switch between MVP and advanced views
- **Feature gates**: Enable/disable features per user preference
- **Progressive loading**: Load advanced features only when needed
- **Backward compatibility**: Always support MVP functionality
