# TODO - Prepare App for Production Deployment

## Remove Unwanted Files
- [ ] Remove old profile.html (duplicate, replaced by profile-updated.html)
- [ ] Remove js/profile.js (replaced by js/profile-updated.js)
- [ ] Remove any unused or test SQL files if not needed for production

## Verify Production Readiness
- [ ] Ensure all CSS files are minified and optimized (e.g., css/modern-styles.css, css/profile-enhancements.css)
